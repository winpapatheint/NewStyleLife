                                                    1. When purchasing items shipped from overseas (meaning outside the territory of the country where the recipient is located), users must confirm in advance whether the item can be sold, transported, and imported, and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Users are responsible for full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations governing international trade and shipping of goods. Duties (simplified customs duties) and other taxes may be imposed on items shipped from overseas during customs clearance in the destination country. Unless otherwise specified in the sales conditions, these additional costs are generally borne by the user. We or the seller will provide the necessary information on the items purchased by the user, such as the item name and price, to international shipping companies and relevant authorities such as customs to facilitate customs clearance and compliance with regulations.<br>
                                                    2. If we provide users with international shipping services or other services related to international transactions through this service, users must comply with all applicable rules established by us. We reserve the right to change or suspend all or part of the services provided or to be provided at our discretion based on this paragraph.<br>
                                                    3. If automatic translation tools are available for all or part of the content posted on the Asian Food Museum Platform and communications between users to be translated into the languages of the relevant countries, users agree to their use. We may provide users with tools to translate content as needed. The accuracy and availability of translation tools are not guaranteed.<br>
                                                    4. If we provide means to transport goods overseas, users agree that we may disclose their personal identification information, information about the goods (including images, descriptions, and product listing information and specifications, hereinafter referred to as "product information"), and order information to the transport company designated by us for handling, export, customs clearance, and international shipping of goods. Users understand that we cannot manage the personal information protection policies of the transport company and its affiliates and service contractors, but they may be subject to these policies.<br>

                                                    1. The responsibility for returns and exchanges lies with the users and the product providers, who are the parties to the transaction. We do not assume any responsibility for this and do not act as agents for users or product providers.<br>
                                                    2. Users may request returns or exchanges from the product provider through the Asian Food Museum Platform within 7 days from the date of delivery of the goods. However, the seller shall ensure sufficient consideration and care regarding any restrictions on returns set by the product provider. Additionally, users cannot request returns or exchanges in the following cases:<br>
                                                    &emsp;&emsp; 1) If the goods are lost or damaged due to the user's fault.<br>
                                                    &emsp;&emsp;2) If the value of the goods has decreased due to use or partial consumption by the user.<br>
                                                    &emsp;&emsp;3) If the value of the goods has decreased over time, making resale difficult.<br>
                                                    &emsp;&emsp;4) If the packaging of the goods is damaged.<br>
                                                    &emsp;&emsp;5) If there are reasonable grounds for refusing the user's request for return or exchange.<br>
                                                    3. The shipping costs and associated fees required for returns or exchanges shall be borne by the party responsible for the reason for return or exchange (the user or the product provider).<br>
                                                    4. If goods shipped from overseas are returned for reasons solely at the user's convenience, the return may be practically impossible due to the high cost of return shipping. We or the seller are not responsible for this. Additionally, regardless of the circumstances, we are not responsible for returns, and we may charge the user's account for any costs incurred by us related to the return.<br>
                                                    5. Refunds due to transaction cancellations, returns, or other reasons will be made using the payment method used at the time of purchase. We may charge users fees for refunds and refund transfers. Interest will not be paid on refunded money.<br>
                                                    6. Refunds to bank accounts will be completed when the user initiates the refund request. If a refund to a bank account is required for an order, the user must check the refund status in the "Settlement" section of their Asian Food Museum Platform account, register their bank account, and initiate the refund request.

                                                    1. Our company may charge a prescribed usage fee when a member applies for a paid service provided by our company. Users shall bear any taxes that may be imposed on the usage fee, and such taxes shall be paid together with the usage fee by the payment deadline.<br>
                                                    2. Our company may change the handling fee in a timely manner by posting a notice of the changes on the Asian Food Museum Platform 14 days before the change. However, no prior notice is required for changes that involve temporary discounts or reductions in fees.<br>
                                                    3. If the user's payment method fails to function or payment is not made to the user's account by the payment deadline, our company may recover the amount due by charging another payment method registered with us and may appoint a collection agency or agent to take legal measures to recover the unpaid amount. Additionally, our company may, at its discretion, impose late payment fees on unpaid amounts that have reached the fulfillment period by the payment deadline. Our company or its agents may also report information about the user's account to credit reporting agencies, and as a result, delays in payment, default, or other non-performance related to the user's account may be reflected in the user's credit information.

                                                    8. 出店者は、商品の在庫数量など変動事項についてデータを適切に管理しなければならず、SHSで販売/取引の条件に関する各種データを虚偽入力してはなりません。<br>
