                                                    1. Sellers must comply with legal requirements related to the sale of goods on this site, and our company reserves the right to determine whether the relevant products are appropriate.<br>
                                                    2. Sellers must directly register and manage information about products and sales conditions through the Seller Sales Management System (hereinafter referred to as "SHS"). While our company may assist or support sellers with data input tasks with their consent, sellers are responsible for the final verification of the information input by our company.<br>
                                                    3. When displaying the selling prices of products and optional items, sellers must include all amounts of consumption tax, additional taxes, customs duties, etc., which should be borne by purchasing members, in addition to the displayed prices. Sellers must also consider standard commission fees, optional fees, shipping fees, etc., imposed by our company when determining selling prices, shipping fees, etc., and decide them on their own.<br>
                                                    4. Our company may engage in sales promotion activities by reducing, waiving, or refunding transaction-specific fees at its discretion to facilitate transactions between sellers and
                                                    members. In this case, it does not affect the amount that sellers originally should receive for settlement. The final selling price or transaction amount settled by purchasing members reflects these adjustments.<br>
                                                    5. For the activation of transactions, our company may expose products registered by sellers to third parties or on sites and other media operated by our company, and such products may be exposed at selling prices reflecting the adjustments mentioned in item 4 above.<br>
                                                    6. Sellers must comply with requests for the issuance of receipts by purchasing members. By agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, our company is considered delegated the authority to issue receipts.<br>
                                                    7. Sellers, as eligible invoice issuers, must comply with requests for the issuance of eligible invoices by purchasing members. If sellers register the necessary information for issuing eligible invoices in the company system, our company may act as an agent for issuing invoices based on that information. However, any errors in the invoice content due to incorrect information registration by sellers shall be the responsibility of the sellers.<br>
                                                    8. Sellers must appropriately manage data regarding changes such as stock quantities of products and must not input false data regarding sales/trading conditions (SHS).<br>
                                                    9. Sellers must not sell products to members or direct them to other websites, bypassing this site or inducing them to bypass it, attempting to cleverly circumvent established transactions or procedures already established on this site. If they violate this, our company may terminate the membership of the relevant vendor.<br>
                                                    10. Sellers must implement warranty services for the products sold at their own responsibility and expense.

                                                    2. If sellers fail to ship the goods within the deadline mentioned in the preceding paragraph, our company may, at its discretion, cancel the order/transaction, and our company shall not be liable for any damages incurred by the seller as a result.<br>
                                                    3. Sellers are responsible for errors in delivery, such as delivering products different from those ordered, delivering to incorrect addresses, or delivering damaged goods, as well as for negligence in delivery.<br>
